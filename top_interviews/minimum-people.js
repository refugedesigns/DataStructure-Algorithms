/*
You are given a list of integers where each element represents the answer of a person in a room to the following question:

"How many other people (excluding yourself) are wearing the same t-shirt as you?"

Each integer x indicates that the person belongs to a group of x + 1 individuals (including themselves) who all wear the same t-shirt.

Your task is to compute the minimum number of people that must be in the room, assuming all responses are truthful and logically consistent.

ðŸ“Œ Examples
Example 1:
Input: [1, 4, 1]

Two people said "1", which implies groups of size 1 + 1 = 2.
â†’ These two can be grouped together.

One person said "4", meaning they belong to a group of 5.
â†’ Even if only one person says this, we must count all 5 people.

Output: 7
âœ… 2 people (group of 2) + 5 people (group of 5) = 7 people

Example 2:
Input: [30, 30, 30]

Each person says "30", meaning each is in a group of 30 + 1 = 31.

Only 3 people gave this answer, but they can all fit into one group of 31.

Output: 31
âœ… Minimum of one group of 31 covers all 3 respondents.
